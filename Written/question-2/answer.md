Errors found:

For the JavaScript, since there is no value for attached to any of the list items as well as that it only returns the first element with the specified selector, the function comes out null and displays an error.

For CSS, the display: none is being overwritten by the display: flex because it comes after display: none. Div and section elements are also given classes with the same name so it makes the code inefficient. The underline under the page heading is also not showing because of incorrect styling.

For HTML, there is a div inside the ul tag which makes it inherit the style of the ul.
